# Spotifi

A replica of the Spotify application that can create new playlists on a spotify account.

## About Spotifi

Spotify is a music platform connected to Spotify that uses the Spotify API to integrate data. It will connect to your Spotify account, allowing you to view all your playlists in your Spotify account and even create new ones! You can also add multiple tracks to your playlist, and search for the tracks you want.

On spotifi you have to login, where you first land before you connect your Spotify account to Spotify, once logged in you will be able to access to create a new playlist where you can search for the desired song and add it to a new playlist. Then you can login when you have finished creating what you want.
